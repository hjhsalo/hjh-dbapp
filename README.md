# DbApp -clitool

This is a cli tool for interacting with a Oracle
database in context of a school programming assignment.

Maven is used for dependency management and for
packaging the application as a single jar file.

## To build

Clone this repository or obtain the source code via
some other means and at the repository root:

* Run `mvn clean compile assembly:single`  
  to build a jar file with all dependencies included.  
  (RECOMMENDED)

* Run `mvn package`  
  to build jar file with just DbApp classes and resources.  
  (Make sure that you have all dependencies in classpath.)

## To run

* Run the application with  
  `java -jar ./hjh-dbapp/target/hjh-dbapp-1.0-20200613-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

```

             [-u=<user>] [COMMAND]
Interact with library database
  -c, --connection=<connectionUrl>
                            Connection URL to DB.

                            (DESCRIPTION= (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=toldb2.
                              oulu.fi) (PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SID=toldb19)))
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
  -p, --password=<password> Password of the username.
  -t, --timeout=<timeout>   Timeout for database login in seconds.
  -u, --user=<user>         Login to database with this username.
  -v, --verbose             Verbose mode. Helpful for troubleshooting.
                            Specify multiple -v options to increase verbosity.
                            For example, `-v -v` or `-vv`
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
Commands:
  list-customers  List all customers.
  list-items      List all items.

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure you can physically connect to the database, or change the connection URL to something else.
* Default username and password are provided. Change them as needed.
* Increase verbosity to see stack traces of SQL and connection related errors.
